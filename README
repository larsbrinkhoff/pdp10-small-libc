Small C library for the PDP-10 architecture and TOPS-20 operating
system.

The bin directory contains scripts for simulating ar, as, ld, and
ranlib by using ftp and telnet to call MAKLIB, MACRO, and LINK on a
TOPS-20 machine.  Host, user, password, and working directory should
be entered into the params.exp file.

The include directory has all public header files.

The src directory contains the library implementation.  The .c files
are written to be compiled with the PDP-10 target for GCC which can be
found on http://pdp10.nocrew.org/gcc/.  The .s files are in TOPS-20
MACRO syntax.  The pre-compiled .o and .a files are in LINK .REL
format.
